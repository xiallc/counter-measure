# CounterMeasure
CounterMeasure is a GUI application supporting XIA's UltraLo 1800 alpha counter. 

## Note on .NET Support
.NET 4.5 (v1.1.32 and later): Installation of CounterMeasure v1.1.32 and later 
requires an update of Microsoft .NET Framework. This update is performed automatically 
by the CounterMeasure installer if your computer is connected to the Web. If your UltraLo 
laptop is offline, use another computer to download 
[Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1 Offline Installer](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40779) 
and install it on the laptop prior to installing CounterMeasure.

Driver installation updates (v1.1.38 and later): Due to updated security standards 
related to the verification of driver installation packages, installation of 
CounterMeasure v1.1.38 and later requires [Windows 7 security update KB3033929](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/3033929). This 
update is installed automatically via Windows Updates. It can also be downloaded 
[directly from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46148).

Windows 10 may display a warning "**Windows protected your PC**: Windows Defender 
SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might 
put your PC at risk." XIA tests and cryptographically signs all installers prior 
to release, so this warning may be ignored. Click "More Info", followed by 
"Run anyway". The installation will request User Account Control and proceed 
normally from there. If Windows reports a problem with the digital signature, 
stop installing and contact [XIA support](mailto:support@xia.com).
